bettergeobook.title.limestone=Limestone
bettergeobook.text.limestone=Limestone is a sedimentary rock. It forms when marine organisms, like corals and clams, sink to the seafloor, get buried to later crystallize to minerals after a long time. Fossils are common in limestone.
bettergeobook.title.marble=Marble
bettergeobook.text.marble=Marble is a metamorphic rock which forms when limestone is subjected to high temperatures and high pressures. Marble is often light coloured, but may have tones of blue, pink, yellow or grey.
bettergeobook.title.pegmatite=Pegmatite
bettergeobook.text.pegmatite=Pegmatite is a magmatic rock that forms dykes or pipes. It has coarse crystals and may contain rare minerals. Pegmatites can be of several colours but often have similar tones as granites: grey, red to pink or black.
bettergeobook.title.schist=Schist
bettergeobook.text.schist=Schist is a metamorphic rock which can form when a fine-grained sedimentary rock, like shale, is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Schists are foliated and glittering from mica minerals.
bettergeobook.title.shale=Shale
bettergeobook.text.shale=Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock. It is foliated and may be light to dark coloured. Black shale often contains a lot of organic material. Shale forms when clay gets buried at the seafloor and then compacted to a rock with distinct layers.
bettergeobook.title.skarn=Skarn
bettergeobook.text.skarn=Skarn is a metamorphic rock that often contains ore minerals, minerals which have a lot of metals and may be worth mining. Skarn forms in limestone which is altered by hot fluids from a magma.
bettergeobook.title.sandstone=Sandstone
bettergeobook.text.sandstone=Sandstone is a sedimentary rock which form when sand is compacted, cemented and creates a rock after a long time. It is often light colored but can be many colors: brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white or black. Sandstone can be banded or have other structures.
bettergeobook.title.sedimentary=Sedimentary rocks
bettergeobook.text.sedimentary=If gravel, sand and clay sink to the seafloor to form compact layers called sediments they may eventually become rocks. For example, sandstones and mudstones are formed this way. Shells of marine organisms can also form sediments, this way limestone is formed.
bettergeobook.title.magmatic=Magmatic rocks
bettergeobook.text.magmatic=Magmatic rocks come from a magma. Fine-grained rocks, like basalt, form when magma in the form of lava flows out on the Earths surface and cools quickly.

Crystals in other colours are called amethyst (purple), citrine (yellow), rose quartz (pink) and smoky quartz (grey). Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in the crust after feldspar.
bettergeobook.title.gabbro_1=Copper
bettergeobook.text.gabbro_1=Copper may be recovered from the minerals chalcopyrite and chalcocite in the rocks gabbro and basalt. Copper has good electrical conductivity and is important in electronics. Copper is for example used in all computers, smartphones, cars and airplanes.
bettergeobook.title.gabbro_2=Titanium
bettergeobook.text.gabbro_2=Titanium is often recovered from the mineral ilmenite that can be present in gabbro. Ilmenite is a dark mineral which is slightly magnetic. Titanium is light and strong and used in for example aircrafts and ships.
bettergeobook.title.bettergeoironore=Iron
bettergeobook.text.bettergeoironore=Iron is the third most abundant metal in the crust. Many minerals contain iron, such as the minerals hematite and magnetite which can be seen in banded iron formations. Some iron minerals, like magnetite, are magnetic.
bettergeobook.title.zincblende=Sphalerite
bettergeobook.text.zincblende=The mineral sphalerite is mined to recover zinc. It is yellow, brown or grey. Zinc is mostly used to make stainless steel. It can also be alloyed with copper to make brass. Zinc makes alloys more resistant to corrosion.
bettergeobook.title.wolfram=Wolframite
bettergeobook.text.wolfram=Wolframite is a grey to black-brown mineral that is mined for tungsten. Wolframite can sometimes be found in skarn. Tungsten is used in steel to make it stronger and more heat resistant. The word â€œtungstenâ€� comes from the Swedish words tung sten, which means heavy stone/rock.
bettergeobook.title.tin=Cassiterite
bettergeobook.text.tin=Cassiterite is a black-brown to grey mineral which is mined for tin. It can sometimes be found in pegmatite. Tin is a soft metal which is mostly used as a solder in electronics, but also to make bronze alloys.
bettergeobook.title.lithium=Spodumene
bettergeobook.text.lithium=Spodumene is a mineral that can have different colours: white, grey and pink are examples. It is mined from pegmatites for lithium, an important metal in for example batteries. Lithium is light and soft in its pure form.
bettergeobook.title.ree=Monazite
bettergeobook.text.ree=Monazite is a mineral which is mined for rare earth elements. The rare earth elements are used in modern technology such as computers and smartphones. Monazite is often reddish brown but can be brown, yellow, pink, green or grey.

#Alloy

bettergeobook.title.steel=Steel
bettergeobook.text.steel=Steel is an iron alloy which is used in almost everything, from airplanes and cars to electronics, buildings and cutlery. There are many types of steel, like extra strong or light, depending on which elements are used in the alloy. The main element is however iron.
bettergeobook.title.bronze=Bronze
bettergeobook.text.bronze=Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze is resistant and easy to cast. It began to be used already over 4,000 years ago in anything from tools to statues. Today, bronze is used in for example machines, music instruments and coins.
bettergeobook.title.brass=Brass
bettergeobook.text.brass=Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Brass with a low copper content is often red. The brass becomes more yellow as more zinc is added. The zinc content in brass is commonly between 5 and 45 percent.
bettergeobook.title.slag=Slag
bettergeobook.text.slag=Slag is what is left after processing the rocks for the elements you want. Some elements can however not be recovered, but is left in the slag. With modern techniques, the slag may be recycled and even more elements can be recovered!
bettergeobook.title.ash=Ash
bettergeobook.text.ash=Ash is formed when minerals are processed in a smelter. It is like fine sand and spreads easily with the wind. Ash often contains several metals, for example titanium. If enough ash can be gathered it is possible to recover metals from it!
