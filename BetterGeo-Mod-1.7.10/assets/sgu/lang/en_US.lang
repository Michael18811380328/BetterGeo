#Soil

bettergeobook.title.moraine_0=Till
bettergeobook.text.moraine_0=Till is Sweden's most common soil type and covers about 75 percent of Sweden's land area. It was formed when the inland ice sheet crushed and transported rock and soil. Till is an unsorted soil which means that it can contain a mixture of clay, sand, gravel, stones - and even large blocks.
bettergeobook.title.moraine_1=Boulder Till
bettergeobook.text.moraine_1=Just like regular till, boulder till is the result of the grinding and displacement of rock and soil by an inland ice sheet. This type of till contain, as the name suggests, a remarkable amount of boulders, often with a diameter greater than 1m. The abundance of boulders make areas with boulder till difficult to dig or pass with most vehicles. This type of till is not suitable for cultivation.
bettergeobook.title.moraine_2=Clay-rich Till
bettergeobook.text.moraine_2=Just like regular till, clay-rich till is the result of the grinding and displacement of rock and soil by an inland ice sheet. This type of till is relatively rare and is found in areas of easily eroded sedimentary rocks such as limestone, shale and sandstone. Clay-rich till have a high proportion of clay particles (over 15 percent) and is suitable for cultivation.
bettergeobook.title.pebble=Pebbles
bettergeobook.text.pebble=Pebbles is the accumulation of only gravel and therefore is referred to as a sorted soil. Waves sorted out other material such as sand or clay leaving only the gravel. Shingle sometimes marks the Highest coastline (HK), i.e. the highest level that the water reached after the inland ice sheet melted away.
bettergeobook.title.glacialerratic=Glacial Erratic
bettergeobook.text.glacialerratic=Glacial erratic are huge boulders that have been broken off from bedrock and transported by glaciers or inland ice sheet. The boulder travels in the direction of the ice flow until the ice melts, leaving the boulder in the terrain. Glacial erratic can have a different composition than surrounding rock.
bettergeobook.title.peat=Peat
bettergeobook.text.peat=Peat is an organic soil that forms when partially decomposed plants accumulate in overgrown lakes or waterlogged land. Peat is formed in marshes and bogs. The difference between the two is that the bogs only get water from precipitation, while marshes also have access to groundwater.
bettergeobook.title.bauxite=Bauxite
bettergeobook.text.bauxite=Bauxite is an aluminium rich soil formed primarily in tropical environments, through chemical weathering of bedrock. Bauxite is one of the world's largest sources of aluminium, an element that is abundant in the Earth's crust but only found in compounds. Aluminium production therefore requires processing of bauxite.

#Rock

bettergeobook.title.alumshale=Alum shale
bettergeobook.text.alumshale=Alum shale is a variety of shale which formed around 500 million years ago in Sweden. The dark rock contains a lot of organic material which have been preserved and created shale oil between the layers. Alum shale often contains several fossils.
bettergeobook.title.andesite=Andesite

bettergeobook.title.diabase=Diabase
bettergeobook.text.diabase=Diabase (or dolerite) is a dark magmatic rock. It forms when a magma intrudes into cracks in the bedrock and cools quickly. There are often light coloured minerals in the dark rock. Diabase is sometimes called black granite when used as building or ornamental stone.
bettergeobook.title.diorite=Diorite
bettergeobook.text.diorite=Diorite is a coarse-grained magmatic rock which forms deep in the crust. It is grey to dark grey but may be black, blue-grey and have green tints. Diorite often has large white and black grains.
bettergeobook.title.gabbro=Gabbro
bettergeobook.text.gabbro=Gabbro is a coarse-grained magmatic rock which forms deep in the crust. It is dark coloured, sometimes black or with green tints. It is an important source for metals like copper and titanium, among others.
bettergeobook.title.gneiss=Gneiss

bettergeobook.title.limestone=Limestone
bettergeobook.text.limestone=Limestone is a sedimentary rock. It forms when marine organisms, like corals and clams, sink to the seafloor, get buried to later crystallize to minerals after a long time. Fossils are common in limestone.
bettergeobook.title.marble=Marble
bettergeobook.text.marble=Marble is a metamorphic rock which forms when limestone is subjected to high temperatures and high pressures. Marble is often light coloured, but may have tones of blue, pink, yellow or grey.
bettergeobook.title.pegmatite=Pegmatite
bettergeobook.text.pegmatite=Pegmatite is a magmatic rock that forms dykes or pipes. It has coarse crystals and may contain rare minerals. Pegmatites can be of several colours but often have similar tones as granites: grey, red to pink or black.
bettergeobook.title.schist=Schist
bettergeobook.text.schist=Schist is a metamorphic rock which can form when a fine-grained sedimentary rock, like shale, is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. Schists are foliated and glittering from mica minerals.
bettergeobook.title.shale=Shale
bettergeobook.text.shale=Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock. It is foliated and may be light to dark coloured. Black shale often contains a lot of organic material. Shale forms when clay gets buried at the seafloor and then compacted to a rock with distinct layers.
bettergeobook.title.skarn=Skarn
bettergeobook.text.skarn=Skarn is a metamorphic rock that often contains ore minerals, minerals which have a lot of metals and may be worth mining. Skarn forms in limestone which is altered by hot fluids from a magma.
bettergeobook.title.sandstone=Sandstone
bettergeobook.text.sandstone=Sandstone is a sedimentary rock which form when sand is compacted, cemented and creates a rock after a long time. It is often light colored but can be many colors: brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white or black. Sandstone can be banded or have other structures.
bettergeobook.title.sedimentary=Sedimentary rocks
bettergeobook.text.sedimentary=If gravel, sand and clay sink to the seafloor to form compact layers called sediments they may eventually become rocks. For example, sandstones and mudstones are formed this way. Shells of marine organisms can also form sediments, this way limestone is formed.
bettergeobook.title.magmatic=Magmatic rocks
bettergeobook.text.magmatic=Magmatic rocks come from a magma. Fine-grained rocks, like basalt, form when magma in the form of lava flows out on the Earths surface and cools quickly. When, however, a magma cools deep in the crust, which happens more slowly, coarse-grained rocks like granite may form.
bettergeobook.title.metamorphic=Metamorphic rocks
bettergeobook.text.metamorphic=Rocks that have been subjected to high temperatures or pressures are transformed to creat new rocks that are called metamorphic. The change (metamorphism) happens when the rock is brought to greater depths in the crust. The metamorphic rock has for example different texture or hardness.
