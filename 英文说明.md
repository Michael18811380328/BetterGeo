### **Features:**

#### **Igneous Rocks**

Rock types formed when magma or lava from different levels of the Earth’s crust cool and crystallize.

- **Granite** is placed in sustained masses with various sizes and at various depths below ground. You can find granite in mountains, e.g. underlying other rock types. Granite is often abundant near gneiss and is found in the continental crust (the continental crust is present on land and can continue under the oceans). Caves can be found in granite. Function: Building block, is one of the sources of cordierite and feldspar.
- **Gabbro** is mostly found in the oceanic crust under the sea, but can be found in some environments on continental crust. Gabbro is found under layers of sedimentary rocks, granite and gneiss. You can also find blocks of gabbro with titanium and copper. Function: Building block, source of copper and titanium (gabbro with copper is one of the new blocks that replace the former block red stone ore).
- **Andesite** is an igneous rock which can be found together with diorite, granite and gabbro. Function: Building block.
- **Diorite** is an igneous rock which can be found together with andesite, granite and gabbro. Function: Building block.
- **Basalt** is found in the oceanic crust under the sea, either as a smooth layer directly under the oceans or with gabbro on top. Copper can be found in basalt (which partly replaces the former block of red stone ore). Function: Building block, source of copper.
- **Pumice floats** on the water surface in reality and of course it does in this mod too. If you drop your pumice blocks in water the will float and if the water is moving, the pumice blocks will move in the same direction as the water. Also, if you put two pumice blocks next to each other in water, they will break. So be careful if you use pumice as a building block. Function: Building block.

#### **Metamorphic Rocks**

Rock types that have undergone changes in minerology, texture, and/or chemical composition in a substantially solid state as a result of heat and/or pressure.

- **Gneiss** (the metamorphic equivalent of a granitic rock) is placed in sustained masses with various sizes and various depths. You can find gneiss in the continental crust and in mountains, often close to granite sequences and with other rock types above. You can also find gneiss under the oceans (the continental crust continues from land and out under the ocean). Caves can be found in gneiss. Function: Building block, is one of the sources of cordierite.
- **Skarn** can be found at deeper depths in the crust and is often seen as the contact surface between limestone, marble and granite. Skarn is one of the new iron and copper ores, and replace the former blocks of iron ore and red stone ore. Function: Building block. Skarn is one of the bigger sources of metals in the mod (e.g. iron, rare earth elements, tungsten and copper).
- **Marble** (the metamorphic equivalent of limestone) is found adjacent to banded iron formations (BIFs), other metamorphic rocks (e.g. schist) or by itself in big masses underground. It can also be found in the contact zones where skarn is present. You will be able to extract zinc from marble since it contains sphalerite (a zinc-bearing mineral). You will also find the blue rock type lapius lazuli in some marble blocks. Function: Building block, source of sphalerite and lapis lazuli.
- **Schist** (the metamorphic equivalent of shale) is placed deep down in the continental crust along with other metamorphic rocks. Function: Building block.

#### **Sedimentary Rocks**

Rock types that are formed in low-temperature and low-pressure environments through the compaction and solidification or precipitation (cementation) of sediments, rock fragments and minerals that have been transported and deposited on the surface of the Earth.

- **Shale** occurs in horizontal layers in mountains and below ground above metamorphic and igneous rock types, together with limestone or sandstone in a “Grand Canyon inspired” stratigraphy. Function: Building block.
- **Alum shale** is a special type of shale which can be used as fuel. Function: Building block, fuel
- **Sandstone** occurs in horizontal layers of mountains and below ground above metamorphic and igneous rock types, together with limestone or shale in a “Grand Canyon inspired” stratigraphy. Sandstone already exists in Vanilla, but we have added coal to some sandstone blocks and hence it is now a new source of coal (replacing the former coal ore blocks). We have also given the sandstone blocks a new color. Function: Building block, source of coal.
- **Limestone** occurs in horizontal layers of mountains and below ground above metamorphic and igneous rock types, together with shale or sandstone in a “Grand Canyon inspired” stratigraphy. Limestone is like sandstone one of the new coal ores and replaces the former coal ore blocks. Function: Building block, source of coal.
- **Banded Iron Formation** (BIF) is found in masses or single blocks next to other sedimentary rocks like shale, limestone and sandstone, but also near marble. Banded iron formations are one of the new iron ores and replace the former iron ore blocks from Vanilla. By mining banded iron formations you will get iron – an important resource for some of the new recipes! You will be able to track iron by using the magnetic compass. The compass will react when you are less than 20 blocks away from an iron source. Function: Building block, source of iron.
- **Fossils** can be found in sedimentary rocks, with a little luck!

#### **Veins and Pipes**

Veins and pipes are formed when magma intrudes lateral and vertical fracture zones and other weak points in the host rock. This can happen near spreading zones between tectonic plates, rift systems etc.

- **Diabase** is an intrusive rock type pictured as veins in this mod. Function: Building block.
- **Pegmatite** is an intrusive rock type pictured as veins in this mod. Blocks of pegmatite can weather after some time if placed by the player. Function: Building block and contains several resources: garnet, aquamarine, tantalum, tourmaline, emerald, feldspar, tin and lithium.
- **Quartz** is a common mineral in reality as well as in this mod. Quartz is found in veins, sometimes bearing gold or gold and silver together. The former gold ore block is replaced by quartz with gold in this mod. Function: Building block, source of gold and silver.
- **Kimberlite** is an igneous rock type that is placed in pipes in this mod. Some of the kimberlite pipes contain diamonds. The former diamond ore block is replaced with blocks of kimberlite with diamonds in this mod. Function: Building block and source of diamonds.

#### **Soil Types**

BetterGeo introduces different soil types to the game. The soils have different properties, like cultivation speed and hardness.

- **Till** is the result of the grinding and displacement of rock and soil by an inland ice sheet and can be found in many biomes. Till replaces dirt.
- **Clay-rich till**. Just like regular till, clay-rich till is the result of the grinding and displacement of rock and soil by an inland ice sheet. This type of till is relatively rare and is found in areas of easily eroded sedimentary rocks such as limestone, shale and sandstone. Clay-rich till have a high proportion of clay particles (over 15 percent) and is suitable for cultivation. Clay-rich till replaces dirt.
- **Boulder till**. Just like regular till, boulder till is the result of the grinding and displacement of rock and soil by an inland ice sheet. This type of till contain, as the name suggests, a remarkable amount of boulders, often with a diameter greater than 1m. The abundance of boulders make areas with boulder till difficult to dig or pass with most vehicles. This type of till is not suitable for cultivation. Boulder till replaces dirt.
- **Pebbles** is the accumulation of only gravel and therefore is referred to as a sorted soil. Waves sorted out other material such as sand or clay leaving only the gravel. Shingle sometimes marks the Highest coastline (HK), i.e. the highest level that the water reached after the inland ice sheet melted away.
- **Glacial** erratic are huge boulders that have been broken off from bedrock and transported by glaciers or inland ice sheet. The boulder travels in the direction of the ice flow until the ice melts, leaving the boulder in the terrain. Glacial erratic can have a different composition than surrounding rock.
- **Bauxite** is an aluminum rich soil type formed in tropical environments as a result of the subsequent chemical weathering of underlying parent rocks. Bauxite in this mod is placed in big and sustained masses above granite and adjacent to or surrounded by limestone, shale or gneiss in tropical environments. Bauxite is one of the larger sources of aluminum both in reality and in this mod. Function: Source of aluminum, which will be used for making the jet pack.
- **Weathered tropical soil** is formed in jungle biomes. It replaces dirt.

#### **Gemstones**

Gemstones are rock types, minerals, pearls, corals or amber which after certain treatment (e.g. splitting or polishing) become attractive and are often kept as personal possessions.

- **Garnet** is a mineral that will be found in pegmatite blocks.
- **Topaz** is a mineral will be found in pegmatite blocks.
- **Cordierite** is a mineral that will be found in granite and gneiss.
- **Aquamarine** is a blue mineral that will be found in pegmatite blocks.
- **Tourmaline** is a mineral that will be found in pegmatite blocks.

#### **Metals and Other Resources**

Metals and other resources like minerals, rock types and elements are found in the soil or bedrock in different environments.

- **Iron (Fe)** is a base metal that can be found in skarn and banded iron formations (BIFs), and these blocks replace the former iron ore block. Iron can be tracked by using the magnetic compass. Functions: Iron will be used in recipes for e.g. steel, prospector’s pan and batteries with lithium.
- **Copper (Cu)** is a base metal that is found in blocks of skarn, basalt and gabbro which are new copper ore blocks and replace the former block red stone ore. You will be able to track copper since the flower Alpine Cathchfly (Lychnis alpina) can be used as an indicator of copper deposits in the nearby ground. Function: Copper will be used in alloys, the magnetic compass, the monster warning system and the battery charger.
- **Gold (Au)** is a precious metal that can be found in quartz veins or by placer mining in rivers.
- **Tantalum (Ta)** is a transition metal that can be found in pegmatite veins. Function: Is used in the recipe for making the heart starter.
- **Titanium (Ti)** is a transition metal that can be found in gabbro. Function: In recipes for heart-starter and jet pack.
- **Silver (Ag)** is a precious metal that can be found in quartz veins where gold also is present.
- **Tungsten (W)** is a transition metal that can be found in skarn. Function: Is used in the process for making steel.
- **Lithium (Li)** is an alkali metal that can be found in pegmatite veins. Function: Lithium can be widely used in the mod since the batteries are made of lithium. The batteries will be used in the heart starter, jet pack and monster warning system.
- **Tin (Sn)** is a metal that can be found in pegmatite veins. Function: Is part of the recipe for brass alloys.
- **Sphalerite** is a mineral that can be found in blocks of marble. Function: Is used for making zinc ingots and brass alloys.
- **Feldspar** is a mineral that occurs as a resource in granite, gneiss and pegmatite. Function: Is used as a building block for the melting furnace.
- **Aluminum (Al)** is a base metal that can be found in bauxite. Function: Is part of the recipe for the jet pack.
- **Rare Earth Elements (REEs)** are elements that are found in small concentrations in the Earth’s crust. In reality the REEs are represented by 17 different elements. Function: REEs are used in recipes for heart starter and battery charger.
- **Coal (C)** is one of the elements in Vanilla that could be found in coal ores, but in this mod coal is found in limestone and sandstone. Function: Fuel.

#### **Placer Deposits**

- Are grains and fragments of gems and metals that have been transported from the source of origin (usually by streaming water) and deposited by gravity separation through sedimentation. These can be found in sand and streaming water near the original source. It can be mined by placer mining where you use a prospector’s pan.

#### **Weathering of Limestone**

- Water breaks down limestone blocks with time, similar to reality where the chemical reaction between limestone and water causes the limestone to dissolve.

### **Crafting Recipes:**

Smeltery

- A smeltery is needed when you want to extract your metals from the ore and make them useful. Blocks/drops that you can put in to the smeltery in order to get pure ingots are: bauxite, gabbro with titanium, gabbro with copper, iron from skarn och banded iron formations and sphalerite from marble. You need to put 8 pieces of each in the smeltery to make it start. Different amounts of waste slag will be produced during the process. You can put 10 slag pieces in the smeltery once more to extract more of the metal. You will also need various amounts of coal or buckets of lava in the process as fuel. You can fill 1-3 slots in the oven for the extraction, which represents different energy levels for the process. The number of slots varies depending on which metal you want to extract.
  The smeltery will also produce pollution in the form of ash! Build a Flue Gas Cleaner to stop the spreading of pollution.
- Composed by: One oven and eigth pieces of feldspar.
